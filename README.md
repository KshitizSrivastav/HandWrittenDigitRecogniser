•	Build and train a neural network, which recognizes handwritten digits with a mind-blowing accuracy. It is able to recognize the digits from 0 to 9.

•	It makes use of MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples of handwritten digits
that are already classified correctly.

•	It makes use of libraries such as cv2 , Tensorflow , Keras Module , Matplotlib and Numpy
